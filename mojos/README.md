Here are others mojo/py versions for tests purposes:

- `sudoku_optim.mojo` is my attempt to optimize the original algo, with mojo/lang optimizations (not the algo!)
- `dojo.mojo` is another algo from mojodojodev https://mojodojo.dev/guides/benchmarks/sudoku.html (the fastest, and from far !)
- `dojo.py` is the py version of mojodojodev ^^ (a lot longer than my sudoku.py version)
